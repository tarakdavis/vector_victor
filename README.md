Vector and Matrix Math

Implement various vector and matrix math functions without using third-party math libraries and loops.

## Objectives

Understand list comprehensions.
Understand introductory linear algebra concepts.
Be able to perform mathematical operations on complex list structures.


## Files included
A linear_algebra.py module with your implementation.
A linear_algebra_tests.py file containing unit tests.

## Description
Implemented these linear algebra functions:
vector shape in shape()
vector addition in vector_add()
vector subtraction in vector_sub()
vector sum in vector_sum()
dot product in dot()
vector multiplication by a scalar in vector_multiply()
mean of multiple vectors in vector_mean()
magnitude in magnitude()
These functions are all defined in the Vector & Matrix Formulas notebook included with this assignment as well as the linear algebra unit tests.
